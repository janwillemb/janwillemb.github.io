The teacher may also have the students complete “drill and practice” activities on computers to practice basic skills, such as typing.


                </td>
                <td points="1">The teacher controls the type of technology and how it is used. The teacher may be pacing the students through a project, making sure that they each complete every step in the same sequence with the same tool. Although the students are more active than students at the Entry level in their use of technology, the teacher still strongly regulates activities.
                </td>
                <td points="2"> The teacher allows for some student choice and exploration of technology tools. Because the students are developing a conceptual and procedural knowledge of the technology tools, the teacher does not need to guide students step-by-step through activities. Instead, the teacher acts as a facilitator toward learning, allowing for greater student engagement with technology tools.
                </td>
                <td points="3">The teacher guides, informs, and contextualizes student choices of technology tools and is flexible and open to student ideas. Lessons are structured so that student use of technology is self-directed.
                </td>
                <td points="4">The teacher serves as a guide, mentor, and model in the use of technology. The teacher encourages and supports the active engagement of students with technology resources. The teacher facilitates lessons in which students are engaged in higher-order learning activities that may not have been possible without the use of technology tools. The teacher helps students locate appropriate resources to support student choices.

                </td>
                <td points="3">The teacher fosters a collaborative learning environment and supports students’ meaningful choices in their selection of technology tools for collaboration.
                </td>
                <td points="4">The teacher seeks partnerships outside of the setting to allow students to access experts and peers in other locations, and encourages students to extend the use of collaborative technology tools in higher order learning activities that may not have been possible without the use of technology tools.

                <td points="1">The teacher provides some opportunities for students to use technology in conventional ways to build knowledge and experience. The students are constructing meaning about the relationships between prior knowledge and new learning, but the teacher is making the choices regarding technology use.
                </td>
                <td points="2">The teacher creates instruction in which students’ use of technology tools is integral to building an understanding of a concept. The teacher gives the students access to technology tools and guides them in exploring and choosing appropriate resources.
                </td>
                <td points="3">The teacher consistently allows students to select technology tools to use in building an understanding of a concept. The teacher provides a context in which technology tools are seamlessly integrated into a lesson, and is supportive of student autonomy in choosing the tools and when they can best be used to accomplish the desired outcomes. 
                </td>
                <td points="4">The teacher facilitates higher-order learning opportunities in which students regularly engage in activities that may be impossible to achieve without the use of technology tools. The teacher encourages students to explore the use of technology in unconventional ways and to use the full capacity of multiple tools in order to build knowledge.

                </td>
                <td points="2">The teacher creates instruction that purposefully integrates technology tools and provides access to information on community and world issues. The teacher directs the choice of technology tools, but students use the tools on their own, and may begin to explore other capabilities of the tools.
                </td>
                <td points="3">The teacher encourages students to use technology tools to make connections to the world outside of the instructional setting and to their lives and interests. The teacher provides a learning context in which students regularly use technology tools and have the freedom to choose the tools that, for each student, best match the task.
